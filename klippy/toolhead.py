""" Notes on 'print_time': https://www.klipper3d.org/Code_Overview.html#time
The print time is synchronized to the main micro-controller clock (the micro-controller defined in the "[mcu]" config section).

It is a floating point number stored as seconds and is relative to when the main mcu was last restarted.

It is possible to convert from a "print time" to the main micro-controller's hardware clock by multiplying the print time by
the mcu's statically configured frequency rate.

The high-level host code uses print times to calculate almost all physical actions (eg, head movement, heater changes, etc.).

Within the host code, print times are generally stored in variables named print_time or move_time.

        When ToolHead._process_moves() is called, everything about the move is known - its start location,
        its end location, its acceleration, its start/cruising/end velocity, and distance traveled during
        acceleration/cruising/deceleration.
        All the information is stored in the Move() class and is in cartesian space in units of millimeters and seconds.

        Klipper uses an iterative solver to generate the step times for each stepper. For efficiency reasons,
        the stepper pulse times are generated in C code. The moves are first placed on a "trapezoid motion queue":
            ToolHead._process_moves() -> trapq_append() (in klippy/chelper/trapq.c).

        Note that the extruder is handled in its own kinematic class:
            ToolHead._process_moves() -> PrinterExtruder.move()
        Since the Move() class specifies the exact movement time and since step pulses are sent to the micro-controller
        with specific timing, stepper movements produced by the extruder class will be in sync with head movement even
        though the code is kept separate.

        The step times are then generated:
            ToolHead._process_moves() -> ToolHead._update_move_time() -> MCU_Stepper.generate_steps() ->
            itersolve_generate_steps() -> itersolve_gen_steps_range() (in klippy/chelper/itersolve.c).

        The goal of the iterative solver is to find step times given a function that calculates a stepper
        position from a time. This is done by repeatedly "guessing" various times until the stepper position
        formula returns the desired position of the next step on the stepper. The feedback produced from each
        guess is used to improve future guesses so that the process rapidly converges to the desired time.

        The kinematic stepper position formulas are located in the klippy/chelper/ directory (eg, kin_cart.c,
        kin_corexy.c, kin_delta.c, kin_extruder.c).

        After the iterative solver calculates the step times they are added to an array:
            itersolve_gen_steps_range() -> stepcompress_append() (in klippy/chelper/stepcompress.c).

        The next major step is to compress the steps:
            stepcompress_flush() -> compress_bisect_add() (in klippy/chelper/stepcompress.c)

        Drip move limits how much of the move is flushed to itersolve and step compress

        When in drip move, the move(there's only one) gets put in trapq and then flushed in short chunks
        until it has fully executed or the condition is triggered. That happens inside _update_drip_move_time.

        It is made this way because when endstop moving we don't want to be committing potentially many seconds
        of movement since we assume the endstop will trigger soon. We don't want to advance next print time
        because the next move will be scheduled at that time.

        For example, if you were to do a homing move that would take 10 seconds max but endstop triggers after 2
        you don't want to wait around until the move would normally have ended before you can start the next move.

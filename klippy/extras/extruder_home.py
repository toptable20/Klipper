# Module distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 licence.
#
#
# This class loads the stepper of the active extruder and performs homing on it.
# It is inspired by the manual_stepper module, and it requires a few changes in
# homing.py and toolhead.py to work: https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/pull/5950
#
# The module requires a modification in "extruder.py", which will create the extruder
# stepper from the PrinterRail class, instead of the PrinterStepper class, when an
# "endstop_pin" is defined in the extruder's config.
#
# A config section is required to activate it, and a command must be sent to use it.
# When activated, some additional parameters must be provided to each [extruder] section.
# For example configuration files, see:
#   config/configs-pipetting-bot/configs-mainsail/printer.cfg
#   config/configs-pipetting-bot/configs-mainsail/home_extruder.cfg

class ExtruderHoming:
    """
    ! WARNING EXPERIMENTAL
    This class registers a command to home an extruder's stepper.
    This is made possible due to a change in the Extruder class,
    which can now add an endstop to the extruder stepper, if a
    config parameter is provided.

    It relies on a great patch for the HomingMove class at "homing.py",
    and small patches in the ToolHead class at "toolhead.py", which
    enable support for extruder homing/probing. These are mainly:
      - Added logic for calculating the extruder's kin_spos/haltpos/trigpos/etc.
      - Added "set_position_e" to the toolhead.

    A note for achaeologists:
    The "toolhead" object that used to be passed to the
    PrinterHoming.manual_home method was mostly "virtual".
    Many methods are defined here, but some of them call the
    methods of the actual toolhead. All of these methods are
    commented out below.
